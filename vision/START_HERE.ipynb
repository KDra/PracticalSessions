    "# TMLSS2018: ConvNets and Computer Vision Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus of the tutorial: Study on the efficiency and robustness of convolutional neural networks for image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I (baseline_start.ipynb): Training a baseline convnet classifier\n",
    "- build a simple classifier given a specific architecture structure\n",
    "- get dataset, apply data augmentation (cropping, flipping)\n",
    "- train classifier\n",
    "- check number of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II (visualisation_start.ipynb): Visualise saliency maps (e.g. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034v2.pdf))\n",
    "- import an already trained model\n",
    "- visualise the gradients of class probabilities w.r.t inputs to obtain saliency maps\n",
    "- visualise inputs that maximize class probabilities \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part III (mobilenet_start.ipynb):  Separable convolutions [Mobilenet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf) \n",
    "- modify the baseline model to use separable convolutions\n",
    "- check number of parameters and compare with above\n",
    "- train the classifier; compare accuracy with baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part IV (distillation_start.ipynb): [Distilling the knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf) from a (larger) teacher model\n",
    "- import an already trained baseline model to use as teacher\n",
    "- use the smaller Mobilenet model as student\n",
    "- add KL distillation loss between teacher and student\n",
    "- train Mobilenet student classifier with this joint loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part V (optional): Test robusness of models using simple geometric transformations\n",
    "- several recent papers have shown that convnets are not robust to simple geometric transformations, e.g. [paper1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12177.pdf), [paper2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09115.pdf)\n",
    "- starting for example from the visualisation colab in part II, write a function that:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- slides crops over Cifar test set images\n",
    ">- feeds the crops into the pre-trained baseline model\n",
    ">- plots predictions per class per crop. Are they stable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- Convolutional models achieve high accuracy in image classification.\n",
    "- Backpropagation is used for training neural networks, but can also be used to visualise what a network has learnt.\n",
    "- Separable convolutions allows reducing considerably the number of parameters in a model, with limited degradation in performance.\n",
    "- Distillation is a simple technique for training smaller models to achieve accuracy similar to larger models. It can be used on its own or in conjunction with separable convolutions. \n",
    "- Although these models are very good, there are still important open research questions about how to make them more robust to various attacks.  "
